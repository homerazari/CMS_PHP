                        <p>Tarot readings can be a highly risky investment. While a good reading can be a great, positive experience; a bad reading can inversely affect you negatively. What makes our tarot readings stand at a standard higher than any where else is that our psychic will take the time to qualify what she's saying to you in a stress free environment. Our psychic will reconstruct your past and align it with your present state prior to branching off into future opportunities. She will organize topics into different categories and clearly define what area of life the discussion will affect. Unlike other psychics, our psychic does not practice the predatory 'per minute' model. Our packages are preset for your needs with no surprises. We here at "Ask Roxy's" know the importance of building healthy relationships with our clients and look forward to building one with you. Please do note due to current restrictions we only accept cash (in person appointments) and bitcoin. Please read below about instructions on how to setup a free and easy bitcoin account.</p>

                        <p>Bitcoin is a new kind of money that can be sent from one person to another without the need for a trusted third party such as a bank or other financial institution; it is the first global, decentralized currency.Bitcoin fees are cheap: Bitcoin transaction fees are usually negligible. Currently, they range from 1/2 cent USD to 5 cents USD, for a bitcoin transaction of any size. Bitcoin is secure: Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a Bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.</p>
                        <span>Bitcoin allows us to transact with our clients in safe and easy manner. Bitcoin transactions are also private, which many of our clients prefer over credit cards. You can either store your own bitcoin wallet or do what we did and use a reputable online service like Coinbase. If you don't have a bitcoin wallet, please read the information below.</span>

You may store your wallet on your computer or use a reputable online bitcoin exchange like Coinbase to hold your wallet. We use Coinbase for our purposes and recommend it to our clients. The link below will instruct you how to set up your account and transfer money to it. After your money has been exchanged for bitcoins and then said bitcoins deposited into your account (ACH transfer takes 2-3 business days to be completed) you may transfer the bitcoins to our account for your appointment. We recommend you set up your wallet with bitcoins deposited into it prior to your appointment as we will need to receive payment prior to rendering service.</p>
